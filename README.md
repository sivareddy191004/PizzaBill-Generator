📄 Project Title: Pizza Bill Generator – Java Console Application
📝 Description:
PizzaBillGenerator is a simple Java-based console application that simulates a pizza ordering and billing system for a fictional restaurant called Pizzamania. It allows users to select a pizza type, customize their order with additional toppings or cheese, and choose whether they want takeaway. The application then calculates and displays the total bill based on user selections.
✅ Features:
Menu-based pizza selection:
Veg Pizza
Non-Veg Pizza
Deluxe Veg Pizza (includes cheese & toppings)
Deluxe Non-Veg Pizza (includes cheese & toppings)
Optional add-ons for normal pizzas:
Extra Cheese (+ ₹50)
Extra Toppings (+ ₹75)
Takeaway option:
Packaging Charges (+ ₹30)
Calculates and displays the final bill
📌 Technologies Used:Java
Java Scanner class for input handling
Basic control structures (if, switch, boolean, etc.)
🧮 How It Works:
The user is prompted to choose a pizza from the menu.
If a regular pizza is selected (not deluxe), the user is asked whether they want extra cheese or toppings.
The user is also asked if they want takeaway, which adds packaging charges.
The total bill is calculated based on the base price and selected options.
The final amount is displayed in a simple bill format.
